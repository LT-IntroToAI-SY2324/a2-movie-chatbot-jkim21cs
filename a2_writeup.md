# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    I still find it difficult to understand how accessing lists work. But I think this is just apart of the learning curve for being exposed to new language. 

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    You could us the match function for extracting information from a movie database by connecting a UI with the movie database and allowing users to input the movie they wish to get information from. The match function would take that user input and match the input to movie database, if the input and the database match, the computer will return the information for that movie.
